Build Your Application using CMake
======================

You built the application with the waf build system in the previous section,
using the same build system used by RTEMS. However, it is generally possible
to use any build system you prefer. CMake is another very common build system
and we are going to build the Hello World application using CMake.

The application is created in :file:`$HOME/quick-start/app/hello` as well.
